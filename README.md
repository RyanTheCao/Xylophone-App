# Xylophone App

This is a xylophone app made with the help of the course of the London App Brewery. I have sent constraints on the project, so the app should work on every single screen. Everything should work as long as you change the development team to your own Apple ID. That step is crucial. Also make sure to change your bundle identifier.
